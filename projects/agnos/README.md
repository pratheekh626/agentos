# 🏢 AgentOffice

**Self-growing AI teams in a pixel-art virtual office — powered by local LLMs.**

Watch AI agents walk to desks, think, collaborate, hire interns, assign tasks to each other, execute code, search the web, and grow their team — all rendered in real-time pixel art with persistent memory across sessions.

> **Zero lock-in.** Runs 100% locally with Ollama. Swap for any OpenAI-compatible API.

## ✨ What Can It Do?

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🧠 **LLM-Powered Agents** | Each agent has their own Ollama-powered brain with personality traits |
| 💬 **Agent-to-Agent Conversations** | Agents talk to each other autonomously and respond to messages |
| 🎯 **Click-to-Follow Focus Mode** | Click any agent sprite to have the camera smoothly track them |
| 📋 **UI Task Assignment** | Assign tasks from the TaskBoard — or agents create tasks for each other |
| 🤝 **Dynamic Hiring** | Agents can hire new team members (interns, devs, designers) on their own |
| 🔧 **Tool Execution** | Sandboxed JS execution, web search, note-taking, file reading |
| 💾 **Persistent Memory** | SQLite-backed memories survive server restarts with importance-weighted recall |
| 🔍 **Semantic Memory Search** | Ollama embeddings + cosine similarity for intelligent memory retrieval |
| 🏗️ **Layout Editor** | Drag-and-drop furniture placement, saved to database |
| 📊 **System Activity Log** | Real-time feed of all agent events with deduplication |
| 💡 **Emote Bubbles** | Action-specific emoji (💻💬😌🔧🚶💡) above agent sprites |
| 🪑 **Furniture Interaction** | Agents walk TO desks to work, approach each other to talk |

---

## 🎬 How It Works

```
You open the browser → pixel-art office loads → Alice (Engineer) and Bob (PM) spawn
  → Each agent runs a think loop every ~15s via Ollama
  → LLM returns: { thought, action, target, toolCall }
  → Server executes the action (move, talk, use_tool, hire_agent)
  → Colyseus syncs state to all connected browsers in real-time
  → Agents remember everything via SQLite + Ollama embeddings
  → Teams grow as agents decide to hire new members 🚀
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Data Flow:**
```
Ollama ←→ OllamaAdapter ←→ Agent.think() ←→ Colyseus State ←→ Phaser + React UI
                                  ↕                  ↕
                           MemoryStore (SQLite)   ToolExecutor
                           Embeddings (Ollama)    (code, search, tasks)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Node.js** | ≥ 18 | Runtime |
| **npm** | ≥ 9 | Package manager (workspaces) |
| **Ollama** | Latest | Local LLM inference |

### Setup

```bash
# Clone & install
git clone https://github.com/AjStraworern/agent-office.git
cd agent-office
npm install

# Pull the model
ollama pull llama3.2

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Terminal 1: Start server
npm run start --workspace=@agent-office/server

# Terminal 2: Start UI
npm run dev --workspace=@agent-office/ui
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** — watch Alice and Bob come alive! 🎉

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts the **server** (port 3000), **UI** (port 80), **Ollama** (with GPU), and **Redis** (for scaling).

> For CPU-only, remove the `deploy.resources` section from `docker-compose.yml`.

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Change the LLM Model

Edit `packages/server/src/rooms/OfficeRoom.ts`:

```typescript
inference: {
    provider: 'ollama',
    model: 'llama3.2:latest',  // ← Change to any Ollama model
    systemPrompt: '...',
},
```

### Use OpenAI / Gaia / OpenRouter

```typescript
import { OpenAICompatibleAdapter } from '@agent-office/adapters';

private adapter = new OpenAICompatibleAdapter(
    'https://api.openai.com/v1',
    'sk-your-key-here',
    'gpt-4o-mini'
);
```

### Add Agents Manually

```typescript
await setupCoreAgent('charlie', 'Charlie', 'Designer', 15, 15);
```

Or let existing agents hire them dynamically via LLM! 🤝

## 🍴 Fork It & Build Your Own

AgentOffice is designed to be forked and customized. Here's how:

### Step 1: Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agent-office.git
cd agent-office && npm install
```

### Step 2: Customize Agents

Edit `packages/server/src/rooms/OfficeRoom.ts` to change agent names, roles, personalities, and system prompts. The personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism) directly influence agent behavior.

### Step 3: Add Custom Tools

Create new tools in `packages/server/src/tools/ToolExecutor.ts`:

```typescript
case 'my_custom_tool':
    return this.myCustomTool(params);
```

Then add the capability to the agent config.

### Step 4: Change the Office Layout

Modify `furnitureTargets` in `OfficeRoom.ts` or use the in-browser Layout Editor to place and save furniture.
