## Security Measures

This project implements the following security practices:

- Input validation on all API endpoints (field whitelists, enum validation, length limits)
- 1MB body size limit on all POST/PATCH/PUT requests
- Path traversal protection on static file serving
- No hardcoded credentials or private paths in source
- Environment variables for all configurable paths
- Prototype pollution prevention via explicit field copying
